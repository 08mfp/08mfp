- 👋 Hi, I’m Mohamed Farid (@08mfp)
- 🌱 I’m currently a Second-Year Computer Science Student at The University of Manachester, Graduating in July 2025.
- 👀 I’m interested in Coding _(mainly Front-End & Database type applications/websites)_, Formula 1, and Football. However, i consider myself a Full-Stack developer as i have experience on both Front-End and Back-End development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that you feel would improve both our skills and coding practices.
- 📫 You can contact me at: contact@mohfarid.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been on the news and been an extra on netflix ✈️
